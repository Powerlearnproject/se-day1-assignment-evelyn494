#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, coding, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software system to meet specific requirements efficiently and reliably.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a. development of programming languages. Introduction of human-readable syntax and structured programming principles such as FORTRAN (1957) – The first high-level language, designed for scientific computing.
b. the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.Software development was no longer seen as just coding but as an engineering process requiring structured methodologies. this Encouraged the use of structured programming, modular design, and formal testing and Influenced methodologies like the Waterfall Model.
c.The advent of structured programming in the 1970s. It introduced a disciplined approach to programming that emphasized code readability, maintainability, and better software efficiency. it influenced later paradigms like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and procedural programming.
d.the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. published by a group of software developers advocating for iterative and flexible development which significantly shifted the focus from rigid, document-heavy development to adaptive, customer-focused approaches hence laying the foundation for modern software development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a.Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
b.Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
c.Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
d.Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
e.Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
f.Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is: 1. Sequential and structred
              2. Follows a linear sequence
              3. Rigid as changes are difficult once development starts
              4. Client involvement is Limited to the beginning and end of the project
              5. Testing is done at the end of the development cycle
          Example scenarios:
            1. Banking system- where all requirements must be clearly defined
            2. Aerospace software development- where rigid specifications must be met
Agile is: 1. Iterative and flexible
          2. Divided into small cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback and iterations
          3. Highly adaptable to changing requirements
          4. Client involvement is Continuous involvement throughout the development cycle
          5. Continuous testing throughout development
    Example scenarios:
      1. Startup mobile apps - where frequent changes and user feedback influence development
      2. E-commerce platforms -  where continuous updates and feature additions improve user experience


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer: Responsible for writing code
                      implementing software solutions.
2.Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3.Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
importance of IDEs:
          1. Multi-Language Support making them versatile for different projects.
          2. Integration with Other Tools such as compilers and third party plugins
          3. Code Organization provide project management tools to structure and navigate large codebases.
          4.Efficient Debugging built-in debuggers help developers identify and fix errors quickly.
        Examples:
         1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code
         2. PyCharm
         3. PyCharm
importance of VCS:
      1. Collaboration – Multiple developers can work on the same codebase without conflicts.
      2. Change Tracking – Keeps a history of modifications, making it easy to revert to previous versions.
      3.Code Backup and Security – Ensures that code is not lost due to accidental deletions or system failures.
      4.  Continuous Integration (CI/CD) – Facilitates automated testing and deployment.
    Examples:
     1. GitHub
     2.GitLab
     3. Apache Subversion    


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges: 
    1. Tight Deadlines and heavy workload which results in rushed development and compromised quality.
    2. Changing Requirements during the development cycle leading to project delays
    3. Keeping Up with Rapidly Changing Technology
    4. Miscommunication while working with multiple engineers, designers and managers
    5. Security and data Privacy concerns
  Strategies:
   1. Effective communication
   2. prioritization of tasks
   3. regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.
   4. agile methodologies


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing: 
    It involves testing individual components or functions of a program in isolation.
    Purpose: Ensures that each unit works as expected and identifies bugs early.
2. Integration Testing:
     Tests how different components or modules of the system interact with each other ensuring that data flows correctly between integrated unit.
     Purpose: Detects issues when modules communicate and Reduces system failures by ensuring smooth module interactions.
3. system Testing:
     Tests the entire software application as a complete system and Ensures that the software meets functional and non-functional requirements
   Purpose: Validates that the system works as intended under real-world conditions and Ensures compatibility across different environments
4. Acceptance Testing:
    he final phase of testing, where the system is validated against business requirements
   Purpose: Confirms that the software meets user expectations before deployment and helps prevent costly post-release issues.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
a. Prompt engineering helps ensure that the AI’s output aligns with the user's specific needs, leading to more accurate and relevant responses. 
b.Prompt engineering allows users to break down complex queries into manageable parts for better results.
c.Prompt engineering can mitigate some of the biases inherent in AI models by framing the question in a way that encourages neutral, fact-based answers. 
d. Prompt that specify the type of response expected can help control the depth, tone, and style of the generated text.
e. Well-crafted prompts reduce the need for follow-up clarifications and allow the user to get the right answers on the first try. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about climate change."
Improved Prompt:
"What are the main causes of climate change and how do they impact the environment?"
Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1.Clear focus: It directly specifies that the user wants to know about the causes of climate change and its impact on the environment. This helps the AI model generate more targeted and relevant information.
2.Specificity: By mentioning the causes and the impacts, the prompt narrows down the scope, making it easier for the AI to provide a concise, meaningful response.
3.Concise structure: The prompt is compact yet detailed, allowing the model to understand the exact nature of the request without excessive elaboration.
4.Context for depth: The prompt suggests an informative response, guiding the AI to offer a comprehensive answer while focusing on the causes and effects, avoiding irrelevant information.
